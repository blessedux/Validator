# TRUFA Score — Trustless Revenue Utility & Flow Automation

## What Is the TRUFA Score?

The **TRUFA Score** is the core metric used in DOB Protocol’s Validator to assess how autonomous, verifiable, and revenue-generating a DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) project or real-world infrastructure asset is.

**TRUFA** stands for:
**Trustless Revenue Utility & Flow Automation**

It reflects how close a project is to operating without human intervention, generating revenue that is transparent, programmatically verifiable, and distributed on-chain.

## TRUFA Score Scale (0–100)

| Score | Meaning                                                                |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Fully manual operation, no verifiability, black-box cash flow          |
| 25    | Basic revenue documentation, some historical data, but no live metrics |
| 50    | Partially automated device with API exposure, still human-managed      |
| 75    | Fully connected device with live metrics and automated revenue         |
| 100   | Autonomous, decentralized machine + on-chain revenue + fallback logic  |

## What the TRUFA Score Measures

1. **Automation of Revenue Flow**
   - Is revenue generated by a machine, service, or system autonomously?
   - Is revenue received in a digital, traceable, and non-custodial way?

2. **Verifiability**
   - Are the inputs and outputs measurable in real-time?
   - Is there an API or sensor-based way to confirm uptime, usage, or delivery?

3. **Auditability**
   - Can stakeholders independently verify cash flow, status, and performance?
   - Are there receipts, hashes, or logs stored in an immutable system?

4. **Contingency Protocols**
   - What happens if the device goes offline?
   - Is there a self-healing mechanism or fallback routine?

5. **On-chain Integration**
   - Does the project stream revenue or proofs on-chain?
   - Can its state be read/tracked via smart contracts or oracle feeds?

## Current Evaluation Criteria (Manual Phase)

Until automation is fully in place, validation is conducted by human validators using the following real-world criteria:

| Category                 | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Device Type**          | What kind of machine (e.g., EV charger, router, solar inverter)?   |
| **Proof of Ownership**   | Uploaded invoice or proof of purchase                              |
| **Uptime Evidence**      | Screenshots, logs, or dashboards showing operation time            |
| **Revenue Receipts**     | Any financial report, payment log, or flowchart of cash generation |
| **Maintenance Schedule** | Upload of service logs, warranty terms, or repair history          |
| **Connectivity**         | API or live dashboard access provided?                             |
| **On-chain Readiness**   | Has the team set up wallet flows, oracle endpoints, or streams?    |

## The Future of TRUFA: Autonomous Certification

We are actively building an AI-powered, fully automated certification system to evolve the TRUFA Score into a trustless validator of DePIN revenue streams.

### Future Features:

- Agent-based data collectors that interact with devices and their APIs
- LLM-based logic validators that cross-check submitted data against expected performance
- Smart contract scoring that updates scores and pushes hashes to Stellar
- Machine identity verification through proof-of-location and uptime beacons
- Auto-ingestion of project metadata from third-party registries or manufacturers

This enables DOB Protocol to become the first AI certifier for machine revenue in the decentralized economy — a neutral agent that approves or rejects yield-producing assets based on verifiable automation and transparency.

## Real-World Use Cases

Here are examples of projects undergoing validation and TRUFA scoring:

1. **eHive EV Chargers (Chile)**
   - Device receipts, power grid logs, expected APY: 30% annually
   - Semi-automated revenue flow with monthly payouts

2. **Rural Solar Microgrids**
   - Proof of energy produced, smart inverter APIs
   - Community usage data verified via satellite internet logs

3. **LoRaWAN Gateway Farms (Helium-compatible)**
   - Public block explorer data for uptime
   - Revenue reported in tokens with frequency and range metrics

## Summary

The TRUFA Score is a critical part of DOB Protocol’s mission to bring transparency, automation, and auditability to the Machine Economy. Through its evolution into a trustless AI certification layer, it will serve as a universal standard for evaluating yield-bearing physical infrastructure — laying the foundation for decentralized finance of real-world machines
