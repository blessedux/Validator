# NPM Supply Chain Attack Mitigation Report

Date: September 2025

## Executive Summary

Following the recent major supply chain attack affecting popular NPM packages (including `chalk`, `strip-ansi`, and others), we have implemented several security measures to protect our codebase. This report outlines the actions taken and current security status of the DOB Validator project.

## Attack Context

A significant supply chain attack compromised the NPM account of developer `qix`, affecting packages with over 1 billion combined weekly downloads. The malicious code included a crypto-clipper designed to steal cryptocurrency by manipulating wallet addresses.

## Project Security Status

### 1. Direct Dependencies Analysis

Our project's direct dependencies have been audited. Critical findings:

- ✅ None of the directly compromised packages are direct dependencies
- ⚠️ Several deprecated packages identified:
  - `critters@0.0.25` (recommended to switch to `beasties`)
  - `soroban-client@1.0.1`
  - `stellar-sdk@13.3.0`

### 2. Security Measures Implemented

#### a. Package Version Overrides

We've implemented strict version overrides for all potentially affected packages:

```json
{
  "chalk": "5.3.0",
  "strip-ansi": "7.1.0",
  "color-convert": "2.0.1",
  "color-name": "1.1.4",
  "is-core-module": "2.13.1",
  "error-ex": "1.3.2",
  "has-ansi": "5.0.1",
  "simple-swizzle": "0.2.2"
}
```

#### b. Automated Security Monitoring

- ✅ Dependabot configured for all workspaces:
  - frontend/
  - backend/
  - shared/
  - Daily security updates enabled
  - Automated pull requests for vulnerabilities

#### c. Dependency Management

- ✅ Using pnpm for better dependency management
- ✅ Workspace integrity checks implemented
- ✅ Lock files regenerated with security overrides

### 3. Current Vulnerabilities

#### High Priority

- None detected in direct dependencies
- No known compromised packages in use

#### Medium Priority

- Deprecated packages need updating:
  - `critters` (functionality replacement needed)
  - `stellar-sdk` (version update needed)
  - `soroban-client` (version update needed)

#### Low Priority

- Several peer dependency warnings in React ecosystem (not security-related)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. Update deprecated packages:

   ```bash
   pnpm remove critters
   pnpm add beasties
   ```

2. Update Stellar-related packages:
   ```bash
   pnpm update soroban-client stellar-sdk
   ```

### Long-term Security Improvements

1. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
2. Add integrity checks for critical dependencies
3. Consider implementing a private NPM registry
4. Regular security audits of dependency tree

## Monitoring & Maintenance

- Daily automated security checks via Dependabot
- Weekly manual review of dependency updates
- Monthly comprehensive security audit

## Conclusion

The project has been successfully hardened against the recent NPM supply chain attack. While there are no immediate security concerns, addressing the deprecated packages should be prioritized in the next sprint.
