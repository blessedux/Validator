# File Upload and Documentation Bug Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the critical fixes implemented to resolve file upload issues and documentation display problems in the DOB Validator application.

## Issues Identified

### 1. CORS Error with File Uploads

**Problem**: When the frontend was running through ngrok (`https://1c70e9ad2006.ngrok-free.app`), file uploads failed with CORS errors when trying to access the backend at `http://localhost:3001`.

**Error**:

```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3001/api/files/upload' from origin 'https://1c70e9ad2006.ngrok-free.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

### 2. createObjectURL Error in Device Review

**Problem**: The `DeviceReview` component was failing with `createObjectURL` errors when trying to display uploaded files.

**Error**:

```
Uncaught Error: Failed to execute 'createObjectURL' on 'URL': Overload resolution failed.
```

**Root Cause**: The code was attempting to use `URL.createObjectURL()` with `FileInfo` objects (returned from backend) instead of native `File` objects.

### 3. Backend Response Format Mismatch

**Problem**: The frontend expected `response.type` but the backend was returning `response.mimetype`, causing file type detection issues.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Frontend Proxy Architecture

Created a proxy system in the frontend to handle backend communication:

#### New Files Created:

- `frontend/app/api/files/upload/route.ts` - Proxy for file uploads
- `frontend/app/api/files/[id]/route.ts` - Proxy for file serving

#### How it works:

```
Frontend (ngrok) → /api/files/upload → Backend (localhost:3001)
Frontend (ngrok) → /api/files/123 → Backend (localhost:3001)
```

### 2. Fixed File Type Handling

Updated the frontend to properly handle both `File` objects and `FileInfo` objects:

**Before**:

```typescript
src={URL.createObjectURL(file)}
```

**After**:

```typescript
src={file instanceof File ? URL.createObjectURL(file) : `/api/files/${file.id}`}
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

Added comprehensive logging and better error messages:

**Before**:

```typescript
toast({
  title: "Upload Error",
  description: "Error uploading file. Please try again.",
  variant: "destructive",
});
```

**After**:

```typescript
console.error("❌ Upload error:", error);
toast({
  title: "Upload Error",
  description: `Error uploading file: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error"}`,
  variant: "destructive",
});
```

### 4. Backend Syntax Fix

Removed unnecessary `return;` statement in the file upload endpoint that could cause execution issues.

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes

- `backend/src/index.ts`
  - Removed unnecessary `return;` statement in `/api/files/upload` endpoint
  - Fixed potential execution flow issues

### Frontend Changes

- `frontend/components/steps/device-documentation.tsx`
  - Changed upload URLs from `http://localhost:3001/api/files/upload` to `/api/files/upload`
  - Fixed `response.type` to `response.mimetype` mapping
  - Added comprehensive logging and error handling
  - Enhanced error messages with detailed information

- `frontend/components/steps/device-review.tsx`
  - Fixed `createObjectURL` usage for all file types (PDFs and images)
  - Added proper type checking for `File` vs `FileInfo` objects
  - Updated preview logic for technical certification, purchase proof, maintenance records, and device images

### New Files Added

- `frontend/app/api/files/upload/route.ts` - File upload proxy
- `frontend/app/api/files/[id]/route.ts` - File serving proxy

## Technical Benefits

1. **CORS Resolution**: Eliminates CORS issues when using ngrok or other tunneling services
2. **Better Error Handling**: Provides detailed error information for debugging
3. **Type Safety**: Properly handles different file object types
4. **Scalability**: Proxy architecture works in both development and production environments
5. **Security**: Backend remains inaccessible from external networks while frontend can serve files

## Testing Results

- ✅ File uploads work correctly through ngrok
- ✅ File previews display properly in DeviceReview component
- ✅ No more CORS errors
- ✅ No more createObjectURL errors
- ✅ Enhanced error messages help with debugging
- ✅ Works with both native File objects and backend FileInfo objects

## Future Considerations

1. **Caching**: The file serving proxy includes basic caching headers
2. **Security**: Consider adding authentication checks to file serving endpoints
3. **Performance**: Monitor proxy performance for large file uploads
4. **Error Recovery**: Consider implementing retry logic for failed uploads

## Deployment Notes

- No database migrations required
- No environment variable changes needed
- Backward compatible with existing file uploads
- Works with existing ngrok setup
